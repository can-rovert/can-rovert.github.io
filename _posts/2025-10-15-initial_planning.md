## Intro
This post exists to detail all the progress between the creation of our team and the creation of this post.

## Team
We are made of six members. Each of us has a set of roles that we are either the primary or support in. We have also set up communications channels for us to contact one-another outside of more formal meet-ups.

## Primary Aim
We have decided on using a Raspberry Pi Pico inside of our CanSat. Also we've decided to use a BMP280 for 

## Secondary Aim
We have decided our secondary aim will be to have our CanSat move upon landing. This will be done using 2 wheels connected to a central axel, the details of this are not clear.

## Website
We have created a website that will host posts about our progress and and more information about the CanSat.
