## For ESA's 2025-2026 CanSat competition

## Who are we?
We are a group of six people, each doing a variety of jobs such as designing, researching, engineering and more for ESA's yearly CanSat project.

## What is a CanSat?
A CanSat is a drinks-can-sized simulation of a satelite usually used to show a concept on a small-scale level. As limitations typically lead to innovation, this shows CanSat teams' abilities and strengths particularly in engineering and problem solving.

## What are we measuring?
We are measuring air temperature and air pressure as is required, as well as a secondary mission of moving it post-landing. This secondary aim will be achieved using wheels on the sides of the CanSat.
